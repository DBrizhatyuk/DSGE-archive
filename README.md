### **Solving DSGE models with Dynare, a collection of examples**
 
Replications of models with level shocks. Among other things, solutions illustrate the use of an external steady state file:

Replications of models with uncertainty shocks. Illustrate the use of higher-order perturbation solution and calculation of IRFs at the ergodic mean in the absence of shocks:
